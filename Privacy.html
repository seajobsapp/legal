Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand the types of information we collect from you, how we use that information, the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties, and your rights in relation to the personal data you provide to us.</p><p>When visiting SeaJobs’s website at <a href="https://SeaJobs.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://SeaJobs.app</a> or any of its affiliated websites (our “<strong>Website</strong>”), using our application “SeaJobs” (our “<strong>App</strong>”) or using any of the services offered via the Website or the App (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), you acknowledge, and where applicable consent to, the practices described in this policy.</p><p>Our Services may contain links to third party services. If you click on a link to access any of those third-party services, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or processing of your personal information. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to such third-party websites.</p><p>Our Services connect you with Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable), giving you the ability to search for, browse, and communicate with Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable). However, we also use automated matching processes facilitated by algorithms within the Services which seek to match you with the most appropriate Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable) by reference to the data you have provided to us along with any criteria specified by the Job Seeker or Employer (as applicable). This may result in decisions being made automatically. For example, we may limit what jobs are visible to Job Seekers based on the qualifications and expertise required for that job. In relation to this automated processing, we ensure there are safeguards in place to protect your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests and you have the right to contest any automated decisions made and obtain human intervention to alter decisions made, where possible. We may also use non-algorithmic methods to match you with Job Seekers who we believe would be suitable candidates or Employers who we believe have a suitable role for you (as applicable). These will always be recommendations and we will not commence any job applications without your involvement and/or consent.</p></div><div class="StaticPage-content__2b1Vm"><h2>Information we may collect</h2><p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p><br><h3>Information that you provide to us.</h3><p>We will ask you to provide us with your information when you:</p><ul><li>fill in forms on our Website, App or correspond with us by phone, email or otherwise;</li><li>register to use our Services;</li><li>use the Services;</li><li>report a problem with our Website, App or Services; or</li><li>complete any surveys we ask you to fill in for research purposes (although you do not have to respond to these if you do not want to).</li></ul><p>For the avoidance of any doubt, any reference in this privacy policy to your data shall include data about other individuals that you have provided us with.
